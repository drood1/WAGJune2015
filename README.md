# StarChildren

Among the stars in the sky lies endless stories of those who existed and continue to exist. Those who nurtured these colossal stars have their own story, one that traces their relationship to the Well of Creation and to one another. Love comes in all different forms and those who chase it endlessly will be rewarded.

A game made with Unity 5 and [Fungus](https://fungusgames.squarespace.com/).
